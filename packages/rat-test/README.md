# Rat Test (rat-test)

## Shell

Rat test adds a Bash script that can run multiple files under the same command. This lets you run multiple Bash tests
with `bash` and multiple TypeScript tests with `ts-node`. By design, the entire process will exit on the first failure.

## TypeScript

Rat test wraps Node functions with an opinionated type API.
